The deep-learning method presented here was deployed in the cosmic-ray helium flux measurement (PhD thesis) as well as in the proton flux measurement (preliminary), as was also presented at the 38th ICRC.

Abstract: DAMPE is a space-borne experiment for the measurement of the cosmic-ray fluxes at energies up to around 100 TeV per nucleon. At energies above several tens of TeV, the electronics of DAMPE calorimeter would saturate, leaving certain bars with no energy recorded. In the present work we discuss the application of machine learning techniques for the treatment of DAMPE data, to compensate the calorimeter energy lost by saturation.
