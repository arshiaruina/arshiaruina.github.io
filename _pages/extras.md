### MAGIC and LST1+MAGIC

The MAGIC (Major Atmospheric Gamma Imaging Cherenkov) telescopes are a pair of IACTs also located on the Canary islands of La Palma. They are designed to operate for gamma rays in the energy range 50 GeV to more than 50 TeV. Built in 2004 and 2009, respectively, they are 85m apart and have (had) different cameras, triggers and readout systems. But they underwent [major upgrades](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0927650515000663) in 2011-2012 that improved the overall performance of the stereoscopic system.

I am also working on familiarising myself with the software pipeline that aims to analyse MAGIC and LST-1 data simultaneously. The possibility of joint observations allows for a stereoscopic system of three telescopes that will render a higher sensitivity than for MAGIC or LST-1 alone. This has the potential to be used in source data analyses. I also hope to contribute to the DC light analyses with MAGIC only, work on which is currently in its very early stages.
