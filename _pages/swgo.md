The [SWGO](https://www.swgo.org) (Southern Widefield Gamma-ray Observatory) is upcoming gamma-ray experiment in South America which is currently in the R&D stage. I am a coordinator in the Outreach and Communications (O&C) working group, whose current focus is on generating awareness about the project, especially in the countries where the candidate sites are located, with special attention to the concerns of the local communities. Given the nascent stage of the project, we are still deciding on the approach towards a more prominent social media presence. 

As far as scientific activities are concerned, I will be making some sensitvity studies for the array in the coming months. More updates on this will follow later!
