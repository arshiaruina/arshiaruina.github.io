# Experiment: DAMPE

During my PhD, I worked in the DAMPE (DArk Matter Particle Explorer) collaboration, which is a space-borne particle detector that was launched in December 2015 and has been taking data since. The detector system consists of a PSD (Plastic Scintillator Detector) for charge measurement, STK (Silicon-tungsten TracKer-convertor) for tracking incident particles,  BGO (bismuth germanium oxide) calorimeter for energy measurement, and NUD (neutron detector) that further aids in lepton-hadron separation. I analysed more than six years of cosmic-ray data to measure the helium flux in the energy range 70 GeV to 1 PeV. In [this work](https://archive-ouverte.unige.ch/unige:170702), I implemented the newly-developed deep learning techniques in the collaboration, a first, to [improve particle tracking and identification](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0927650522000962?via%3Dihub) and to [compensate for the energy lost in the calorimeter at high energies due to saturation of the electronics](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-0221/17/06/P06031). The study confirmed a previously observed hardening feature in the energy spectrum and also a subsequent softening feature that was [reported by DAMPE in 2021](https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.126.201102). Also, a comparison with the proton flux tended to favour the charge-dependant scenario of cosmic-ray fluxes over a mass-dependant one.
