I am pursuing my first postdoctoral position at [INFN Padova](https://www.pd.infn.it/it/) in the (awesome!) group of Michele Doro and Elisa Prandini. My current research focus is split into the study of:
* VHE emissions from blazars and their time-variabilities with the [LST-1 telescope of the CTA project](https://www.cta-observatory.org/project/technology/lst/), and
* cosmic rays using Direct Cherenkov light detection in IACTs like the LST-1 and [MAGIC](http://magic.mppmu.mpg.de), as well as WCDs of the upcoming [SWGO project](https://www.swgo.org/SWGOWiki/doku.php).

(This site is under construction.)

*[VHE]: Very High Energy
*[IACTs]: Imaging Air-shower Cherenkov Telescopes
*[WCDs]: Water Cherenkov Detectors
