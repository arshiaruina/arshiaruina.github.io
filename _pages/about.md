... and thanks for stopping by! 😊

I’m an astroparticle physicist with a deep curiosity about the universe and a strong drive to tackle real-world challenges, especially when it comes to environmental issues, science communication, and science policy.

You’ve probably heard of the [Large Hadron Collider (LHC)](https://home.cern/science/accelerators/large-hadron-collider) at CERN, a 27 km long underground tunnel where scientists smash subatomic particles together at incredibly high energies. But did you know that highly energetic particles from distant galaxies, black holes, and other cosmic phenomena are constantly streaming towards us on Earth? Scientists first discovered this the early 1900s and, since then, as technology and our understanding of physics have improved, these cosmic particles have revealed many mysteries of the universe and hold promise to teach us more!

Over the last decade, I studied these intriguing particles with experiments at the LHC at CERN, with detectors floating in space, and with telescopes on remote mountain-tops, and with teams spread out all over the globe. And it has been as incredible as it sounds! Find out more about my research experiences [here](/research/).

Beyond physics research, I’ve discovered a deep passion for shaping how science meets society. I’m re-orienting my career toward science communication and science policy, especially the vital space where the two intersect. It’s a space often held back by communication gaps, yet it’s exactly where informed, meaningful action can happen.

As the climate crisis and broader planetary emergencies intensify, I’m committed to applying my analytical background, storytelling skills, and systems-level perspective to help bridge that divide. Whether through writing, public engagement, or policy-focused collaboration, I aim to contribute to solutions that support a more resilient, sustainable future.
