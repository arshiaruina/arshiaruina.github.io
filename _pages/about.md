🌌 I work in astroparticle physics, a field that brings together ultra-large-scale phenomena of astrophysics and the super-tiny-scale phenomena of particle physics (but for most of it, I use just a computer!)

👩‍💻 I'm pursuing my first postdoctoral position at [INFN Padova](https://www.pd.infn.it/it/) in the group of Michele Doro and Elisa Prandini

📡 My current research focus is split into the study of:
* VHE emissions from blazars and their time-variabilities with the [LST-1 telescope of the CTA project](https://www.cta-observatory.org/project/technology/lst/), and
* cosmic rays using Direct Cherenkov light detection in IACTs like the LST-1 and [MAGIC](http://magic.mppmu.mpg.de), as well as WCDs of the upcoming [SWGO project](https://www.swgo.org/SWGOWiki/doku.php)

🌏 Besides astroparticle physics, I'm passionate about science communication, space and climate policy, mitigation and conservation efforts. If you know of a project in any of these areas that could use a physicist like me, please get in touch!

*[IACTs]: Imaging Air-shower Cherenkov Telescopes
