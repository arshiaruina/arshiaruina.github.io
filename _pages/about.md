Thanks for stopping by 😊

I’m an astroparticle physicist who’s passionate about environmental issues, science communication and policy.

In underground laboratories like at the [Large Hadron Collider in CERN](https://home.cern/science/accelerators/large-hadron-collider), scientists are smashing subatomic particles at mind-bogglingly high energies. But did you know that highly energetic particles and radiation are coming towards us from faraway space objects like galaxies and black holes ALL the time?

My current work involves using specialised ground-based telescopes to study some of these particles that reach us on Earth. In the past, I worked on space-based detectors and high-energy particle physics. 🛰💥

Besides scientific research, I'm enthusiastic about crafting effective, meaningful communication, particularly when it comes to science. Bonus points if it’s related to climate change (policy, mitigation and adaption), biodiversity conservation, waste management or science policy. 🐋🌿☀️♻️
