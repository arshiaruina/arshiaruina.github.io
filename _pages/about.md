And thanks for stopping by! 😊

I’m an astroparticle physicist with a deep curiosity about the universe and a strong drive to tackle real-world challenges, especially when it comes to environmental issues, science communication, and policy.

You’ve probably heard of the [Large Hadron Collider](https://home.cern/science/accelerators/large-hadron-collider) at CERN, where scientists smash subatomic particles together at incredibly high energies. But did you know that highly energetic particles from distant galaxies, black holes, and other cosmic phenomena are constantly streaming towards us on Earth? And we’re catching them!

Right now, I study some of these cosmic "messengers" using specialised ground-based telescopes. I’ve also worked on space-based detectors and high-energy particle physics projects in the past.

Besides physics research, I’m passionate about crafting effective, meaningful communication, particularly when it comes to science, and even more so when it intersects with the climate crisis, biodiversity conservation, waste management, or science policy. Whether it’s writing, speaking, or collaborating, I love finding creative ways to connect science with society.
