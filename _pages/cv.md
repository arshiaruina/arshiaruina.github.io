A diverse background
------
I worked in space-based detection of cosmic rays with the [DAMPE experiment](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.astropartphys.2017.08.005) during my PhD at the University of Geneva, Switzerland. [My thesis](https://archive-ouverte.unige.ch/unige:170702) was dedicated to the measurement of the cosmic-ray helium flux and the application of deep-learning techniques for [improved particle-track reconstruction](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.astropartphys.2022.102795) and [energy measurement](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-0221/17/06/P06031) in the detector.

Check out the proceedings from ICRC 2023 at Nagoya, Japan [here](https://doi.org/10.22323/1.444.0170) and some amazing pictures from Japan [here](https://www.arshiruina.github.io) (coming soon)!

The research topic of my [master thesis](https://cds.cern.ch/record/2653340) was flavour violation in charged leptons, particularly in the decays of top quarks. This work was carried out at the University of Bonn, Germany, using data from the ATLAS experiment. Prior to that, I dabbled in shorter projects involving the detection of solar axions with the [CAST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CERN_Axion_Solar_Telescope) experiment and hadronic interactions in the [COMPASS](https://wwwcompass.cern.ch/compass/) experiment.

Comms and outreach
------
Besides high-energy physics, I'm enthusiastic about science communication and outreach. This year, I'm serving as a coordinator for the Outreach and Communications group in the SWGO collaboration. (If you're in SWGO and enjoy making animations and videos, get in touch!)

I also actively contribute, along with Merlin Kole, to the Astrowatch section of the [CERN Courier](https://cerncourier.com). 

While at UniGe, and during my undergrad years at the University of Delhi, India, I've volunteered for various science outreach events and held editorial positions, including with journals like [TheScienceBreaker](https://thesciencebreaker.org).
