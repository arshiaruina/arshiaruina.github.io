## Gamma-ray Astrophysics

#### LST-1/CTAO

I started my journey in this field with the [Large-Sized Telescope prototype (LST-1) of the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO)](https://www.ctao.org). The CTA Observatory is a next-generation observatory for gamma-ray astrophysics designed to detect gamma rays in the energy range 20 GeV to 300 TeV. For the best coverage of the full energy range, three categories of telescopes will be deployed: Large-Sized Telescopes (LSTs), Medium-Sized Telescopes (MSTs) and Small-Sized Telescopes (SSTs). The telescopes use the imaging air-shower technique, wherein a VHE gamma-ray photon, on interacting with the Earth's atmosphere, generates a cascade of charged particles that emit Cherenkov light. This faint blue-UV light is emitted when particles travel faster than light in a medium (light travels 0.03% slower in air than in vacuum!) and can be detected by a telescope. The larger the telescope, the lower its energy threshold can go. Therefore, the LSTs are designed to measure the low-energy range while the SSTs will be able to detect the highest-energy gamma rays.

<b>Extra-Galactic Astrophysics</b> 

The origin of gamma-ray emissions in the jets of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs), as well as the location of the emissions along the jets, are important open questions in astrophysics. I'm studying VHE emissions from extra-Galactic blazars, which are a kind of AGN whose jets are closely aligned to our line of sight. As a result, their emissions, strongly modified by relativistic effects, can exhibit strong and rapid variabilities. Studying the variability in the photon fluxes with time can help us understand this better. In particular, I'm analysing the data on the BL Lac object (a kind of blazar) called PG 1553+113 that has been collected by the LST-1, to investigate short-term (intra-night) variabilities in its light curve.

<b>Cosmic Rays with Direct Cherenkov Light</b> 

I am also working towards using IACTs to study cosmic rays using the technique Direct Cherenkov (DC) light detection. Primarly designed to detect Cherenkov light from gamma-ray air showers, IACTs have also been used to study cosmic rays (CRs) using DC light, which is the Cherenkov radiation emitted by a highly energetic CR particle before producing an air shower. The flux of DC light is directly proportional to <i>Z<sup>2</sup></i>, the squared particle charge, whereas that of the Cherenkov light of the shower is proportional to <i>Z</i>. Moreover, being generated at a higher altitude than the EAS, where the air is less dense, the DC light will arrive in a much narrower cone than the the light from the EAS, slightly shifted in position and slightly delayed in time. IACT cameras, like those of CTAO, with a sharp enough angular resolution (~0.1Â° FOV per pixel) and a time resolution of the order of nanoseconds can provide a strong discrimation between DC-light and EAS-light. Further, the dependance of DC-light on <i>Z<sup>2</sup></i> makes it an optimal technique for CR composition measurements, especially for iron, not only because of its high <i>Z</i> but also because of its relatively higher abundance. However, there are still significant limiting factors of this technique which make DC light detection quite challenging.
