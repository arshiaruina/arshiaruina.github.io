I am currently working in ground-based gamma-ray astrophysics but come from a background of space-based cosmic-ray physics and high-energy particle physics. Read on to find out more about these topics and my interest in it!

### LST-1 and CTAO
<a href="#top">Top</a>

I started my journey in this field with the [Large-Sized Telescope prototype (LST-1) of the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO)](https://www.ctao.org). The CTA Observatory is a next-generation observatory for gamma-ray astrophysics designed to detect gamma rays in the energy range 20 GeV to 300 TeV. For the best coverage of the full energy range, three categories of telescopes will be deployed: Large-Sized Telescopes (LSTs), Medium-Sized Telescopes (MSTs) and Small-Sized Telescopes (SSTs). The telescopes use the imaging air-shower technique, wherein a VHE gamma-ray photon, on interacting with the Earth's atmosphere, generates a cascade of charged particles that emit Cherenkov light. This faint blue-UV light is emitted when particles travel faster than light in a medium (light travels 0.03% slower in air than in vacuum!) and can be detected by a telescope. The larger the telescope, the lower its energy threshold can go. Therefore, the LSTs are designed to measure the low-energy range while the SSTs will be able to detect the highest-energy gamma rays.

#### Extra-Galactic Astrophysics
<a href="#top">Top</a>

The origin of gamma-ray emissions in the jets of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs), as well as the location of the emissions along the jets, are important open questions in astrophysics. I'm studying VHE emissions from extra-Galactic blazars, which are a kind of AGN whose jets are closely aligned to our line of sight. As a result, their emissions, strongly modified by relativistic effects, can exhibit strong and rapid variabilities. Studying the variability in the photon fluxes with time can help us understand this better. In particular, I'm analysing the data on the BL Lac object (a kind of blazar) called PG 1553+113 that has been collected by the LST-1, to investigate short-term (intra-night) variabilities in its light curve.

#### CRs with DC Light
<a href="#top">Top</a>

I am also working towards using IACTs to study cosmic rays (CRs) using the technique Direct Cherenkov (DC) light detection. Primarly designed to detect Cherenkov light from gamma-ray air showers, IACTs have also been used to study cosmic rays (CRs) using DC light, which is the Cherenkov radiation emitted by a highly energetic CR particle before producing an air shower. The flux of DC light is directly proportional to <i>Z<sup>2</sup></i>, the squared particle charge, whereas that of the Cherenkov light of the shower is proportional to <i>Z</i>. Moreover, being generated at a higher altitude than the EAS, where the air is less dense, the DC light will arrive in a much narrower cone than the the light from the EAS, slightly shifted in position and slightly delayed in time. IACT cameras, like those of CTAO, with a sharp enough angular resolution (~0.1Â° FOV per pixel) and a time resolution of the order of nanoseconds can provide a strong discrimation between DC-light and EAS-light. Further, the dependance of DC-light on <i>Z<sup>2</sup></i> makes it an optimal technique for CR composition measurements, especially for iron, not only because of its high <i>Z</i> but also because of its relatively higher abundance. However, there are still significant limiting factors of this technique which make DC light detection quite challenging.

### MAGIC and LST1+MAGIC
<a href="#top">Top</a>

The MAGIC (Major Atmospheric Gamma Imaging Cherenkov) telescopes are a pair of IACTs also located on the Canary islands of La Palma. They are designed to operate for gamma rays in the energy range 50 GeV to more than 50 TeV. Built in 2004 and 2009, respectively, they are 85m apart and have (had) different cameras, triggers and readout systems. But they underwent major upgrades in 2011-2012 that improved the overall performance of the stereoscopic system.

I am also working on familiarising myself with the software pipeline that aims to analyse MAGIC and LST-1 data simultaneously. The possibility of joint observations allows for a stereoscopic system of three telescopes that will render a higher sensitivity than for MAGIC or LST-1 alone. This has the potential to be used in source data analyses. I also hope to contribute to the DC light analyses with MAGIC only, work on which is currently in its very early stages.

### SWGO
<a href="#top">Top</a>

The Southern Widefield Gamma-ray Observatory (SWGO) is upcoming gamma-ray experiment in South America, SWGO, which is currently in the R&D stage. I am one of three coordinators in the Outreach and Communications (O&C) working group since January 2024 [27]. The O&C working group is focussing its efforts on generating awareness about the project especially in the countries where the candidate sites are located, with special attention to the concerns of the local communities. Besides, discussions are underway to create a larger social media presence for the collaboration. Given the nascent stage of the project, the current focus of such a presence would be to cover and highlight ongoing developments within the different scientific working groups. An update was recently shared at the 10th SWGO General Meeting, that was held in Mexico City, Mexico this month [28]. As far as scientific activities are concerned, a foreseen task with SWGO would be to make sensitivity studies of the array. In order to do this, the plan is to, first, make similar studies with the CTA-North array and then implement a similar framework for SWGO. I participated in the SWGO-Italy meeting in Naples, Italy held in November 2023 [29] and intend to participate in the next collaboration meeting which is expected to be held in Heidelberg, Germany in September this year.
